# IT Service Request: Software & Tools Needed

Hello IT Team,

I am submitting this request for the installation and/or approval of the following software and utilities to support my work. At my previous role with Tyson Foods (a Fortune 500 company), I was responsible for deploying machines, servers, switches, IoT Edge devices, and data collection systems, and I used Active Directory to help manage users locally. I mention this not because I need to perform those same tasks here, but to demonstrate that I have the experience and will make full use of these tools. I am coming to you directly for approval and installation, rather than seeking workarounds or alternative methods.

Below is a detailed list of the software I need, along with priorities and notes. Items in _italics_ require a license or have licensing comments. Priorities are marked as [Critical], [High], [Medium], or [Low]. Please advise if there are preferred alternatives or additional installation steps.
