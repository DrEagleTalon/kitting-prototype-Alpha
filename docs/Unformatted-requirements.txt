IT Service Request: Software & Tools Needed

Hello IT Team,

I am submitting this request for the installation and/or approval of the following software and utilities to support my work. At my previous role with Tyson Foods (a Fortune 500 company), I was responsible for deploying machines, servers, switches, IoT Edge devices, and data collection systems, and I used Active Directory to help manage users locally. I mention this not because I need to perform those same tasks here, but to demonstrate that I have the experience and will make full use of these tools. I am coming to you directly for approval and installation, rather than seeking workarounds or alternative methods.

Below is a detailed list of the software I need, along with priorities and notes. Items in *italics* require a license or have licensing comments. Priorities are marked as [Critical], [High], [Medium], or [Low]. Please advise if there are preferred alternatives or additional installation steps.

Notes:
- Some software may be redundant if you have company-preferred alternatives.

I am a newly hired Controls Engineer at Huhtamaki’s Marion, Indiana Plant. I am currently working on a standalone prototype for our maintenance kitting area, designed to help visualize and manage kits, bins, and work orders for our maintenance team. To ensure smooth development, I need a stable environment with specific software and tools.
I want to clarify that while I have extensive experience with Python, SQL, and database development, as well as deploying machines, servers, switches, IoT Edge devices, and Active Directory user management from my time at Tyson Foods, I am not requesting Local Admin (LA) rights or any special privileges. I understand that access is granted based on company policy, and I am reaching out to you directly for support rather than seeking workarounds or alternative methods.
Current Situation & Need:
- I currently only have this desktop available for development.
- Our two other Controls Engineers share laptops running specialized software, which often creates driver conflicts—especially when working with older equipment or after updates.
- Using those machines for development risks disrupting critical operations, making them unsuitable for this project and future initiatives.
Requested Solution:
I need one of the following to proceed efficiently:
- Installation of the required software (see attached list).
- A VM with the necessary tools pre-installed for development.
I am open to your recommendations on the best approach, as my priority is ensuring a stable, isolated environment for development without impacting existing PLC laptops or requesting unnecessary access.
I am eager to contribute to meaningful improvements at Huhtamaki and hope to realize my full potential here.
